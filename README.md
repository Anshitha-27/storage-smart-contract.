# storage-smart-contract.
Simple Storage contract is a straightforward on-chain contract designed to store a solitary value. Any user has the ability to transmit a transaction to the Ethereum network in order to modify this value.
# You must install git and install node.js.

Once you have node.js installed, we can install the ethers toolchain. From your terminal, type:
npm install -g ethers-cli
You may wish to install Ganache for later steps, but that is not necessary for now.
